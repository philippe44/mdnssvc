This is a fork from https://bitbucket.org/geekman/tinysvcmdns. It works under
Windows, OSX, and Linux (x86 and ARM) and with Embarcadero C++ builder XE7 
which is not C11 compliant

I've added a function to stop a registered service, send bye-bye packet and 
properly release all allocated memory

I've also added a small real responder

tinysvcmdns
============
tinysvcmdns is a tiny MDNS responder implementation for publishing services.

This implementation is only concerned with publishing services, without a 
system-wide daemon like Bonjour or Avahi. Its other goal is to be extremely 
small, embeddable, and have no external dependencies.

It only answers queries related to its own hostname (the A record), the 
service PTRs, and the "_services.dns-sd._udp.local" name, which advertises 
all services on a particular host.

Services consist of a single SRV and TXT record.

Decoding of MDNS packets is only done to retrieve the questions and answer RRs.
The purpose for decoding answer RRs is to make sure the service PTR is not 
sent out if it is already included in the answer RRs.

It also only utilizes multicast packets, so no "QU" queries are accepted.

There is no name collision detection, so this means no queries are generated
before publishing the services. However compliant responders will avoid using 
our names, since the implementation will respond to queries that match our 
name.


TODO
-----
 * better, more stable & complete API
 * name collision detection


FILES
------
 * mdns.c - provides data structures, parsing & encoding of MDNS packets
 * mdnsd.c - implements the server socket, communication and thread
 * testmdnsd.c - an example that creates an instance until terminated
